I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the School of Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I received my M.Sc. in Robotics from the National University of Singapore in 2024, and my B.Eng. in Electronic Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University in 2023.

My research interests include computer vision, 3D scene generation, robotic perception, SLAM, and autonomous driving.
